# SwiftUITodoTracker

This project marks my initial foray into the world of Swift and SwiftUI, serving as a foundational step in my learning journey.

## Objective

The main objective of this project is to gain hands-on experience with Swift and SwiftUI while exploring the concept of view models in iOS app development. By building a simple todo list application, we aim to understand the fundamentals of Swift programming, SwiftUI for building user interfaces, and the role of view models in separating business logic from the UI.

## Features

- **Todo List Management**: Create, edit, delete, and mark tasks as complete.
- **Learning SwiftUI**: Gain familiarity with SwiftUI syntax, components, and layout techniques.
- **Understanding View Models**: Explore the concept of view models and their role in separating UI logic from business logic.
- **Experimentation**: Use this project as a sandbox to experiment with different Swift and SwiftUI features, such as navigation, data binding, and state management.
